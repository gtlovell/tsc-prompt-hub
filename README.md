This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to a `.env.local` file:

### Firebase Configuration (Public - safe to expose in client-side code)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
```

### Private API Keys (Keep these secret)

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
```

**Note:** Firebase configuration values (NEXT*PUBLIC*\*) are public and safe to expose in client-side code. The API keys for Gemini and Resend should be kept private.

This project is configured for deployment on Netlify with the following features:

- Automatic builds from your Git repository
